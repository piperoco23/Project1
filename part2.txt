1) root directory is the directory that contains all files on the tree (hence the name root).
to change the cwd to root, type the command "cd /". cd means change the directory, and / is the path of the root.
There is no terminal output but you should be able to see that the path displayed in the command prompt is now just "/".

2) touch foo.txt. No output but ls will show the file foo.txt in your current directory.

3) mv foo.txt bar.txt. NO output but ls will show file bar.txt in current directory.

4) whoami. The output is your username on your linux machine ("ubuntu" in my case).

5)whereis ls. The output is the path of the binary: ls: /usr/bin/ls/usr/share/man/man1/ls.1.gz

6) Shell environment variables are variables that consist of information about the OS system and the current shell session.
the printenv command can be used to view shell environment variables.

7) the current shell is an environment variable (SHELL) so we can simply echo $SHELL.
the output is a path: "bin/bash" which represents the language the shell is using, bash.

8) the hostnamectl command will give a lot of information about the system, including the kernel version, which is given on the second to last line.
The complete output is: 
   Static hostname: ubuntu2004
         Icon name: computer-vm
           Chassis: vm
        Machine ID: 5ee791cabf1e44e5942a2367ae0cd3bd
           Boot ID: e392303524ca479f94c5a9147c7bca59
    Virtualization: oracle
  Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS
            Kernel: Linux 5.15.0-57-generic
      Architecture: x86-64
the kernel version is Linux 5.15.0-57-generic

9)ls /bin/ | grep "^ch"
Output: 
chacl
chage
chardet3
chardetect3
chattr
chcon
check-language-support
cheese
chfn
chgrp
chmod
choom
chown
chrt
chsh
chvt
- all of these files start in ch so this is good

10) find /home/ -maxdepth 1 -type f | wc -l
output: 3
(I made three files in the home directory to test if it was counting only files within the home directory)

11) grep --include=\*.c -r "int c" .
Output:
./test.c:int c;
note: test.c is a file i created that only contains "int c;" to test that the command was working
